#The data frame needed for the volcano plot comes from the results function of DESeq2. Something like this:-
#This will give you the log2FoldChange and padj columns that are needed to make the volcano plot. It is completely possible to do this without the annotation data. 
#The annotation is useful for labelling known gene names, but you can make the plot without if you just want to see the general distribution of differential expression results
